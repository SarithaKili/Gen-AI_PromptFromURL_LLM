# Gen-AI Prompt From URL with LLM
🚀 An AI-powered project to extract prompts from URLs and leverage Language Models (LLMs) for intelligent responses.

#Features ✨
📄 Process documents or URLs for AI-driven insights.

🔍 Retrieve relevant chunks using vector databases.

🤖 Query an LLM for natural language responses.
🧩 Supports chunking, embeddings, and retrieval augmentation.
💾 Integration with FAISS for vector similarity search.

#Workflow Overview 🔗
Document Input: Provide URLs or files.
Chunking: Split data into manageable sections.
Embedding: Create vector representations.
Vector Search: Find the most relevant data.
Prompt Creation: Build an intelligent query.
LLM Response: Get contextual and intelligent answers.

#Tech Stack 🛠️
Python: Core programming language.
LangChain: Framework for LLM-based workflows.
OpenAI API: Powering the language model.
FAISS: Efficient similarity search for vectors.

#Installation 🖥️
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/Gen-AI_PromptFromURL_LLM.git
Navigate to the project directory:
cd Gen-AI_PromptFromURL_LLM
Set up a virtual environment:
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate     # For Windows
Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage 🛠️
Run the main script:
python main.py

Input a document or URL for processing.
View the generated LLM response.
